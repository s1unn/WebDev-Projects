    <h1>Hi, I'm Teresa</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        I am a master student in Digital Innovation with a strong interest in technology and environmental sustainability. Over the past year, I have undertaken an intensive training program to become a full-stack web developer, successfully completing a specialized course in Java programming offered by Generation Italy. This experience allowed me to acquire solid skills in both front-end and back-end development, consolidating the theoretical and practical foundations necessary to work in this field.

My multidisciplinary background has equipped me with an analytical, curious, and problem-solving mindset. My academic experience, combined with my training in web development, enables me to tackle challenges with a structured and methodical approach, while maintaining a continuous commitment to updating and improving my skills.
